While automatic doors are nothing new, the vision is to bring the idea into private homes/properties while also making the technology inexpensive and easy to integrate. More specifically our target consumers are those with disabilities and their caregivers, however we want the product to appeal to anyone desiring efficiency and automation in their home.</p> <p>The product will be installable on any lighter-weight swinging interior door. After a simple install, a single button press will open and promptly close the door while multiple sensors collect data along the path. From then on, the door will automatically open any time someone approaches from either side, wait a period of time, and then automatically close. The multiple sensors will be able to detect any obstacles in the way or variations from the typical path and stop the door from becoming hazardous.</p> <p>The function of the product is acheived through the combination of four embedded subsystems:</p> <ul> <li>Motor Subsystem</li> <li>Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem</li> <li>Rotary Encoder Subsystem</li> <li>Resistive Flex Sensor Subsystem</li> </ul> <p>These four subsystems each play a vital role and communicate with each other in order to control the final product.

Product: TOPENS AT6131 Single Swing Gate Opener Medium Duty Automatic Gate Motor.</li> </ol> <p>This Product is for outdoor use, but does the same function. Using a trigger (this gate opener uses a key fob) the gate will swing open at a certain speed and a certain degree. This gate will also close in a similar fashion.</p> Customer Reviews (Positive) Restated Customer Need \"The installation was straightforward, and the system runs smoothly and quietly.

Customer Reviews (Negative) Restated Customer Need \"Gate gave out completely after only a month or so of use in spite of the fact that the gate weight was well inside of the product specs. I couldn't move it manually even though the motor clutch was disengaged. The actuator arm would not retract (open) all the way. It would open 45 degrees and simply stop. I had the limit switches set properly along with the Potentiometers. I tried running the motor off the the gate and still encountered the same issue. One thing that also annoys me is that there is absolutely no way to operate the unit without the key fobs. It would be nice to have an independent switch option inside the control box. In addition, the clutch mechanism, which is activated with a key, seems to lack that solid positive response.\" The product is reliable (Explicit). The product stays powered over a long period of time (Latent). The product should operate without the use of key fobs (Explicit). --- --- \"Took my husband and I 2 days to get put together.

The idea of automatic doors is commonly seen in the public, such as in stores, workplaces, and other businesses to improve accessibility. This project aims to bring the idea into more personal settings such as the interior of homes/private buildings and to improve upon the design of the product. Ideally, the product will overcome competing brands by being a more affordable option and opening up a new group of target consumers. The current target by December 2025 is to have a working prototype with a consumer cost of under $300 which appeals to homeowners who are disabled as well as those simply wanting greater convenience and accesibility in their home. These goals will be achieved by scaling down the power requirements and making the product lighter-duty (lowering material cost therefore improving affordability), using sensors to make it touch-free, and designing it to be as easy to install and setup as possible.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group Product users would be families, those with disabilities, and people who live in houses and work in buildings.</li> <li>Target purchaser The product purchasers would be home, building, and property owners.</li> <li>Retailers Construction companies and realtors who would sell this as an additional feature in new homes.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#use-cases","title":"Use Cases","text":"<p>User Story #1: Matt 25 year old Matt lives alone in his new house with a new puppy. Since he got it he has been meal prepping and slowly adding furniture to his house. He recently got this automatic door opener and closer for his backyard door, bedroom door, and door that leads to the garage. He found it really convinient to have his bedroom door and backyard door open and close themselves whenever his new puppy wanted to go out. This helped him not worry about his new puppy having accidents inside the house or his room while he is sleeping or at work.</p> <p>Matt also has one installed on the door that leads to the garage. When he grabs groceries, he buys enough for the whole month. To make the trips from his car to the pantry the least amount possible his hands are usually full while he walks inside and he dropps a few items every time he opens the door. Having the door automatically open and close helps Matt grab as much as he can from his car to the kitchen without having to worry about trying to open the door with his hands full. His friends also commented how helpful this was when they were moving boxes from his old apartment to his new house. They just walked up towards the door and it opened for them without them having to set the boxes down and pick them back up.</p> <p>User Story #2: Mary</p> <p>Mary is a 32-year-old mother of newborn twins. Her hands are almost always full as she carries her babies around the house or moves baby supplies from room to room. Opening doors while holding both children is difficult and unsafe, so she installed the automatic door opener/closer on her bedroom, kitchen, and nursery doors. Now, when she approaches, the sensor recognizes her presence and automatically opens the door, allowing her to move through without putting the twins down or struggling with handles. This makes her daily routine far less stressful and keeps her focus on caring for her children.</p> <p>As the twins grow older and become curious toddlers, Mary also uses the product on her kitchen cabinets. By enabling the lock and restriction settings, she prevents the children from opening cabinets that contain snacks, chocolate, or cleaning supplies. The clear LED signals help her know when a cabinet is secured, and the manual override via her phone app ensures she can open them easily when needed.</p> <p>At night, Mary and her spouse can gently close and lock the nursery door once the twins are asleep. This gives them some privacy to watch a movie together or relax without worrying that the kids might wander out. For Mary, the automatic door system provides convenience during early motherhood, child safety as her kids grow, and peace of mind knowing her home is more manageable, secure, and family-friendly</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects-and-requirements","title":"Aspects and Requirements","text":"<p>The new product design will be an automatic door opener and closer with the following requirements.

These concepts showcase complete visions of how multiple features\u2014mechanical, sensing, power, and user interface\u2014work together, each with a slightly different focus.</p> Group Feature Detail Free Door Movement Latch The device has a latch inside that unhinges the motor to the door causing the door to open without resistance. - Mechanical Arms The motor is connected to mechanical arms that will rotate and bend to open the door. This will prevent loss of tension and can help with how much power the motor is using. - Auto-Disengage Program If the device senses someone trying to open the door and it is not in a lock setting, then the device will disengage the motor so that the motor is not fighting the user in opening the door. - Motor Auto-Clutch When the door is manually opened, the motor does not activate but also does not fully detach, allowing the door to move freely until movement stops. - Auto-Disengage Program This can happen if the door is locked, latched, or something is blocking the door. To prevent damage to the device and the objects, the device will disengage the motor after it exerts more than 10 lbs of force. - Resistance Testing When the door is being manually opened, any resistance from the motor or other hardware will not exceed 5 pounds. - Ergonomics All interactable elements of the device will have special design consideration to be activatable with one hand, without tight grasping, pinching, or wrist-twisting. - Dust-Proof The main casing is sealed off to prevent dust from gathering on the electronics. Multi-Directional Arm Function Mechanical Arms The motor is connected to mechanical arms that will rotate and bend to open the door. This will prevent loss of tension and can help with how much power the motor is using. - Distance Sensor The device will read at least 32 inches from the door for when the door opens forward so that it follows ADA compliance. This will also prevent the door from opening in front of users and colliding with objects that are moving toward the door. - Motor Speed The motor speed will be controlled to take at least 3 seconds to fully open, and at least 5 seconds to close the door from 90 degrees open. - UI w/ Buttons The device has a user interface which allows the user to program settings through the use of buttons. - Preset Modes The device has multiple preset software modes for the user to choose between after installing the device. Sensor Functionality Sensor The device has an additional sensor focusing on the doorway line to make sure there is nothing in the area. This is important because we do not want the door to shut on people, animals, or objects. - Programmed Timer The device closes the door after an amount of time from when it opened, selected by the user. - Tripwire Sensors The device is linked to sensors placed a few feet past each side of the door. When the user walks past the sensor opposite from the direction they entered, the device closes the door. - Distance Sensor The device will read at least 32 inches from the door for when the door opens forward so that it follows ADA compliance. This will also prevent the door from opening in front of users and colliding with objects that are moving toward the door. - Motor Speed The motor speed will be controlled to take at least 3 seconds to fully open, and at least 5 seconds to close the door from 90 degrees open. - User Setting Limits The device will not allow the user to program the device to close the door sooner than 5 seconds after it has opened. - Forward Sensor This sensor will measure objects equal to the door length plus an additional 6-12 inches. This is important because the door should not open and hit the customer while in use. - Delay in Sensor After someone leaves the sensor view, there will be a delay then it will start closing. This is important so that the door can be closed and locked depending on user preference."},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#concept-models","title":"Concept Models","text":"<p>Below we describe each concept not only by a single sub-feature, but as a more complete system that combines sensing, control logic, mechanical movement, user interface, and signaling\u2014using only features listed above.</p>"},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#model-1-free-door-movement","title":"Model 1 \u2013 Free Door Movement","text":""},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#system-level-concept","title":"System-level concept","text":"<p>Model 1 is a concept focused on safe manual override and low resistance.

We discussed how we would approach this section of the project while we were in class together. We did not meet physically or virtually during the generation of feature ideas. The reasoning for this was that we did not want there to be any bias, \u201chive-mind\u201d thinking, or judgement of ideas, intentional or not. Instead, we each individually came up with solutions to each need or requirement on our own time. We believe that this led to a greater variation of ideas and more thinking outside the box. It also allowed us to come up with ideas that were interesting to consider and get inspiration from, even if they were unconventional, unrealistic, or did not fit the scope/resources of our project. Another part of the process that led to variation of ideas was the amount that were required. Coming up with 100 unique ideas was very difficult, but it further enforced outside-the-box thinking and made us get creative.</p> <p>Collecting ideas was done by first thinking of how we had seen these requirements solved by other products/competitors. Following what works in successful products ensures that ours will be successful as well. At the same time, it is easy to go for the simple solutions without realizing their flaws or comparing them to less conventional ideas that may be even better. Knowing this led us to think about how the problems had not been solved before, at least from what we had seen. We tried to come up with ideas that could work even better than the current standards, or features that would make our product stand out from the rest. This process gave us a mixed result of \u201ctried-and-true\u201d features and innovative ideas to choose from.</p> <p>The list of requirements was formed from both the \u201cUser Needs and Benchmarking\u201d and \u201cProduct Requirements\u201d assignments. More of the requirements were drawn from the user needs because we had a larger list of them at our disposal and they were less specific, allowing us to come up with more feature ideas. However, we did include several of our product requirements since we had already decided they were very important to our end-product. As part of this activity, we updated the Product Requirements document so that each requirement there matches one of the requirement/need statements used in our ideation table, ensuring consistency between the two.</p> <p>Since the ideas were already grouped based on which user need or requirement they referred to, we saw no need to group them into smaller categories before ranking them. The ranking process was simple. We first narrowed the list down by picking ideas that seemed most crucial to the overall goal of our project as well as which ones applied most to our consumer base. After that, we ruled out any features we knew would not be feasible based on our timeline and resources. Any ideas that were very similar did not need to be included twice, so we picked which ones from each likeness were slightly more detailed or inclusive.</p> <p>The team then collected ideas based on patterns we saw which could combine into a greater feature that we wanted to showcase. Therefore, each concept model now represents a more complete vision of the product rather than a single sub-feature:</p> <ul> <li>Model 1 (Free Door Movement) highlights how mechanical arms, safety cutoffs, and manual overrides combine into a system that never fights the user and remains safe in emergencies.</li> <li>Model 2 (Multi-Directional Arm Function) shows how adjustable arms, distance sensing, controlled motor speeds, and preset modes deliver flexible motion while maintaining ADA compliance.</li> <li>Model 3 (Sensor Functionality) demonstrates how multiple sensors, timers, and user setting limits work together to automate opening and closing for users like John\u2019s grandmother.</li> </ul> <p>Across all three concepts, we deliberately emphasized the embedded systems features (sensors, timers, motor control logic, UIs, and feedback signals) that we can realistically build and demonstrate in this class using a microcontroller-based prototype. These concepts provide a look into the future of our product and better define how we as a team want to move forward with the design process while staying anchored to our product requirements.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>The block diagram below shows how our team's individual subsystems connect to each other.

If either of these events happen the motor then stops and waits for further instruction. Depending on the instruction, the door moves back to its previous position or continues to open. This works while it is closing as well.</p> <p>This process allows the product to directly satisfy the following product requirements: - 2.1 - The product must open a door at least 90 degrees. - 2.2 - The sensor must spot a person at 3 feet and open within 1 second. - 3.1 - A first time user must be able to set it up in under 30 minutes. - 6.1 - The force for pushing or pulling upen interior swinging egress doors shall not exceed 5 pounds (22N). - 6.2 - The automatic door will not close if something is blocking the door frame.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#version-20","title":"Version 2.0","text":"<p>If we were to create a new version of our software in the future, there are a few things that could be improved upon:</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#door-rotation-amount","title":"Door Rotation Amount","text":"<p>Rather than have the door open 90 degrees no matter what, we could implement a feature for the door to open to a different amount based on environment/user preference. The first way to do this would be creating a user interface through which the user could specify the amount they would like the door to rotate during setup. The rotary encoder subsytem would store this value and set it as the \"fully open\" point for the whole system. The second option would be to add an additional line of code in the distance-sensing subsystem's calibration phase. This line would periodically check whether the distance to the wall on the opening face of the door was less than or equal to a certain value (e.g., 2 inches). If true, the subsystem would communicate this to the motor subsystem and rotary encoder subsystem. The motor would then stop and the rotary subsystem would set its current rotational value as the \"fully open\" point for the whole system.</p> <p>This feature would be useful because not every door opens to an exact right angle. It would allow users to have more customization of the product. It would also add safety to the product in case there was an object in between the door and the wall during calibration.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#sensor-check-interval","title":"Sensor Check Interval","text":"<p>For the current version of the software, we had the sensors store data at every 10 degrees of door rotation. This was for the sake of simplicity and to conserve processing power during the prototype version of our product. For the market product however, we would reduce this interval to as small as functionally possible in order to maximize the speed of reaction between sensing an obstacle and stopping the motor.</p> <p>As stated several times throughout this website, safety is our number one priority with this project and this improvement would lower the risk of someone/something being struck by the door.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#door-close-delay","title":"Door Close Delay","text":"<p>After fully opening, the software currently causes the door to begin closing immediately once nothing is seen by the distance-sensing subsystem on the closing face of the door. While this seems fine in practice, it could cause the door to begin closing too early if a second user is attempting to walk through the doorway. Although the system would then sense this person and stop the motor, the door might be partially closed at this point which would be inconvenient for the user. Additionally, users might prefer the door to stay open for a while in case they will be leaving the room soon after entering.</p> <p>One way to solve this would be to once again use a user interface during calibration which asks the user how long they would like the door to remain open before closing. This value would then be given to the motor subsystem which would store it and use it as a delay during normal operation. Another solution would be to have the door begin reopening if the sensor on the closing face of the door detects an obstacle while the door is closing.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>While the software in its current state provides the functionality we set out to create, these improvements would make the system even more ideal.

Your goal is to improve your ability as an engineer and our team was so focused to creating something revolutionary that we lost sight of that goal. The best thing we did was find an invention and ask ourselves how we could improve it and how the general population would like it improved. </p> </li> <li> <p>We struggled in time management when it came to this project. As the days progressed we thought we had way more time than we actually did. This lead to some late night meetings and stress that could have been easily remmedied if we planned a bit more effectively. </p> </li> <li> <p>Though we communicated meetings and timelines, we constantly let life take a hold of our time and missed those meetings. There was a part of the team that was lax in those meetings because we were more focused on indiviually getting our work done. This was a problem later on when we needed to communicate on what each piece of information we were giving others. </p> </li> <li> <p>We wanted to add too many extra mechanical safety parts to a whole project which clouded our judgement when making user needs and benchmarking. We needed to focus on the programming part not the mechanical parts. </p> </li> <li> <p>We were fortunate enough to have all four teammates stay for the whole project. That being said, it was very good that we planned for worse case senarios if a sensor was unavailable. We could have also communicated a bit more on what would happen if the motor section was gone, but we felt like that would have to be taken up by someone else and a sensor dropped. </p> </li> <li> <p>We learned that PCBs have a lot more going on inside them than we had thought. We needed to really search and study data sheets to make sure each footprint was correct and there were still some footprints that were overlooked in that process. </p> </li> <li> <p>Our software proposal showed that we had complicated our programing with extra features we didnt nessecarily have to have. The main one was the calibration. Though it was good and important to have, that extended our time in programming because each sensor had two pieces of code it worked on. </p> </li> <li> <p>We learned to be extra careful on the 8-pin connectors and make sure that everyone knew where their information was going. This helped for when we had to plug our breadboards together. We had to do minimal reprogramming because of the pins. </p> </li> <li> <p>We learned that we had to really pay attention to what was asked of us in each assignment. There were times that something was almost overlooked or overlooked because the team skimmed the assignment page. </p> </li> <li> <p>In the end, we did learn that we could work well and complete a working program that interacted with three other subsystems to create a whole system.
