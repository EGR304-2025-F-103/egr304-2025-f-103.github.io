Aukes","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#team-introduction","title":"Team Introduction","text":"<p>The goal of \"Private-Use Door Automation\" is to provide ease of access to consumers through the design of a self-calibrating, automaticly opening and closing door system. While automatic doors are nothing new, the vision is to bring the idea into private homes/properties while also making the technology inexpensive and easy to integrate. More specifically our target consumers are those with disabilities and their caregivers, however we want the product to appeal to anyone desiring efficiency and automation in their home.</p> <p>The product will be installable on any lighter-weight swinging interior door. After a simple install, a single button press will open and promptly close the door while multiple sensors collect data along the path. From then on, the door will automatically open any time someone approaches from either side, wait a period of time, and then automatically close. The multiple sensors will be able to detect any obstacles in the way or variations from the typical path and stop the door from becoming hazardous.</p> <p>The function of the product is acheived through the combination of four embedded subsystems:</p> <ul> <li>Motor Subsystem</li> <li>Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem</li> <li>Rotary Encoder Subsystem</li> <li>Resistive Flex Sensor Subsystem</li> </ul> <p>These four subsystems each play a vital role and communicate with each other in order to control the final product.

I couldn't move it manually even though the motor clutch was disengaged. The actuator arm would not retract (open) all the way. It would open 45 degrees and simply stop. I had the limit switches set properly along with the Potentiometers. I tried running the motor off the the gate and still encountered the same issue. One thing that also annoys me is that there is absolutely no way to operate the unit without the key fobs. It would be nice to have an independent switch option inside the control box.

Ideally, the product will overcome competing brands by being a more affordable option and opening up a new group of target consumers. The current target by December 2025 is to have a working prototype with a consumer cost of under $300 which appeals to homeowners who are disabled as well as those simply wanting greater convenience and accesibility in their home.

Since he got it he has been meal prepping and slowly adding furniture to his house. He recently got this automatic door opener and closer for his backyard door, bedroom door, and door that leads to the garage. He found it really convinient to have his bedroom door and backyard door open and close themselves whenever his new puppy wanted to go out. This helped him not worry about his new puppy having accidents inside the house or his room while he is sleeping or at work.</p> <p>Matt also has one installed on the door that leads to the garage. When he grabs groceries, he buys enough for the whole month. To make the trips from his car to the pantry the least amount possible his hands are usually full while he walks inside and he dropps a few items every time he opens the door. Having the door automatically open and close helps Matt grab as much as he can from his car to the kitchen without having to worry about trying to open the door with his hands full. His friends also commented how helpful this was when they were moving boxes from his old apartment to his new house. They just walked up towards the door and it opened for them without them having to set the boxes down and pick them back up.</p> <p>User Story #2: Mary</p> <p>Mary is a 32-year-old mother of newborn twins. Her hands are almost always full as she carries her babies around the house or moves baby supplies from room to room. Opening doors while holding both children is difficult and unsafe, so she installed the automatic door opener/closer on her bedroom, kitchen, and nursery doors. Now, when she approaches, the sensor recognizes her presence and automatically opens the door, allowing her to move through without putting the twins down or struggling with handles. This makes her daily routine far less stressful and keeps her focus on caring for her children.</p> <p>As the twins grow older and become curious toddlers, Mary also uses the product on her kitchen cabinets. By enabling the lock and restriction settings, she prevents the children from opening cabinets that contain snacks, chocolate, or cleaning supplies. The clear LED signals help her know when a cabinet is secured, and the manual override via her phone app ensures she can open them easily when needed.</p> <p>At night, Mary and her spouse can gently close and lock the nursery door once the twins are asleep.

We discussed how we would approach this section of the project while we were in class together. We did not meet physically or virtually during the generation of feature ideas. The reasoning for this was that we did not want there to be any bias, \u201chive-mind\u201d thinking, or judgement of ideas, intentional or not. Instead, we each individually came up with solutions to each need or requirement on our own time. We believe that this led to a greater variation of ideas and more thinking outside the box. It also allowed us to come up with ideas that were interesting to consider and get inspiration from, even if they were unconventional, unrealistic, or did not fit the scope/resources of our project. Another part of the process that led to variation of ideas was the amount that were required. Coming up with 100 unique ideas was very difficult, but it further enforced outside-the-box thinking and made us get creative.</p> <p>Collecting ideas was done by first thinking of how we had seen these requirements solved by other products/competitors. Following what works in successful products ensures that ours will be successful as well. At the same time, it is easy to go for the simple solutions without realizing their flaws or comparing them to less conventional ideas that may be even better. Knowing this led us to think about how the problems had not been solved before, at least from what we had seen. We tried to come up with ideas that could work even better than the current standards, or features that would make our product stand out from the rest. This process gave us a mixed result of \u201ctried-and-true\u201d features and innovative ideas to choose from.</p> <p>The list of requirements was formed from both the \u201cUser Needs and Benchmarking\u201d and \u201cProduct Requirements\u201d assignments. More of the requirements were drawn from the user needs because we had a larger list of them at our disposal and they were less specific, allowing us to come up with more feature ideas. However, we did include several of our product requirements since we had already decided they were very important to our end-product. These selections combined gave us a list of just over twenty needs/requirements to brainstorm ideas for.</p> <p>Since the ideas were already grouped based on which user need or requirement they referred to, we saw no need to group them into smaller categories before ranking them. The ranking process was simple. We first narrowed the list down by picking ideas that seemed most crucial to the overall goal of our project as well as which ones applied most to our consumer base. After that, we ruled out any features we knew would not be feasible based on our timeline and resources. Any ideas that were very similar did not need to be included twice, so we picked which ones from each likeness were slightly more detailed or inclusive.</p> <p>The team then collected ideas based on patterns we saw which could combine into a greater feature that we wanted to showcase. Therefore, each concept model would highlight a more specific aspect of the product rather than completely different overall designs. The first concept was labeled as \u201cfree door movement\u201d. This refers to a system of features that allows the automatic door to be manually opened by preference or in an emergency. The second concept was \u201cmulti-directional arm function\u201d. This means that we want the door to have an optional programming feature where it can open the door in either direction based on if the user is entering or exiting the room. It also gestured at how exactly we want the door-arm to work. The last concept was \u201csensor functionality\u201d This concept highlighted how the sensors would work to send signals to the motor based on its inputs. The third concept was also a better look at how the system would function as a whole. These concepts provide a look into the future of our product and better define how we as a team want to move forward with the design process.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>The block diagram below shows how our team's individual subsystems connect to each other.

After each signal, all sensors, including the encoder, record analog signal and store it as a variable. This will happen until the rotary encoder reached 90 degrees.
