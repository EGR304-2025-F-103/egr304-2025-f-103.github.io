## Team Introduction

The goal of "Private-Use Door Automation" is to provide ease of access to consumers through the design of a self-calibrating, automaticly opening and closing door system. While automatic doors are nothing new, the vision is to bring the idea into private homes/properties while also making the technology inexpensive and easy to integrate. More specifically our target consumers are those with disabilities and their caregivers, however we want the product to appeal to anyone desiring efficiency and automation in their home.

The product will be installable on any lighter-weight swinging interior door. After a simple install, a single button press will open and promptly close the door while multiple sensors collect data along the path. From then on, the door will automatically open any time someone approaches from either side, wait a period of time, and then automatically close. The multiple sensors will be able to detect any obstacles in the way or variations from the typical path and stop the door from becoming hazardous.

The function of the product is acheived through the combination of four embedded subsystems:

* Motor Subsystem
* Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem
* Rotary Encoder Subsystem
* Resistive Flex Sensor Subsystem

These four subsystems each play a vital role and communicate with each other in order to control the final product. Each subsystem was designed by an individual member of the team.

## Overview

This website exists as a documentation of the project from start to finish. By navigating through the different pages, our hope is that readers are able to fully understand how the idea came about, the purpose for the product to exist, the overall design process, and how the hardware/software of the individual subsystems come together to acheive the end-goal. Below is a short description of each page:
