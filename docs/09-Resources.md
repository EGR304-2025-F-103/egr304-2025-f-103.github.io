## Show of Complete-System Functionality


The video below shows the final state that we were able to acheive for our project. Unfortunately due to multiple class-wide setbacks, we as a team were unable to progress to the stages of soldering our final components to our Printed Circuit Boards, creating a physical housing for the system, or creating a model door to show ideal functionality. However, we did everything we could with the time and resources we were given. In the end, we were able to prepare our individual systems on breadboards, write/program the code for them, and implement full connectivity between them. All four subsystems are shown connected together, sharing a power source, and communicating with one another to function as we intended.
