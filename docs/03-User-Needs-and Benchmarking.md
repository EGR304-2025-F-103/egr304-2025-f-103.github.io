Using a trigger (this gate opener uses a key fob) the gate will swing open at a certain speed and a certain degree. This gate will also close in a similar fashion.

| I couldn’t be more impressed with my Topens Gate Opener! The installation was straightforward, and the system runs smoothly and quietly. The build quality is solid, and the smart features like remote control and auto-close are incredibly convenient. It has handled my heavy-duty gate effortlessly, even during bad weather. What really stood out was their customer support—quick, detailed, and extremely helpful. They answered all my questions with clear instructions and went above and beyond. Top-notch performance, reliability, and service—highly recommend! | The product has easy installation instructions (explicit). |

| I had been using mighty mule for 5+ years. Glad i switched when i needed a new opener. The Topen gate you manually set the at the arm as compared to the MM which you program with the remote. manual way is much easier to set. I had an electric lock already installed which works perfectly with the Topen. the timing on the MM was never quite right. i had so have the arm adjusted to close tight against the stop. otherwise it would bounce off the stop and not lock. It quickly and easily hooked up to wifi, apple homekit and siri. never worked with MM. Very easy setup and the support was immediately there to answer some pre and post purchases questions | The product is easily adjusted (Latent). |

| Waited until I've gotten plenty use in different conditions. I mounted this unit on a pipe fence and it is opening a 16ft thin wall metal gate. Gate may weigh 100lbs or so. Has some issues at first with the gate opening very slowly, not working during any windy days, just seemed weak. After a few months of using it like that that control board broke a piece of solder and the gate quit working. Got with topens and they were very quick to reply and take care of the issues. They sent out a new control board and since then the gate has worked better than new. Plenty of power, good speed, and works during windy days. Highly recommend this company and their products, great customer service. | The product works against natural resistances (explicit). |

| Ok- so I purchased two of these units based largely upon the reviews. I installed both on ranch gates: one 14 foot and one 16 foot. Installation process was, to be honest, lengthy and and labor intensive for me but the directions were quite good and straight forward. I also installed the solar panels with battery backups which appear to work well. So far, the unit on the 14 foot gate has worked problem free.
Unfortunately, the unit I installed on the 16 foot gate gave out completely after only a month or so of use in spite of the fact that the gate weight was well inside of the product specs. For some reason, the screw (or nylon nut) inside of the actuator just froze up. I couldn't move it manually even though the motor clutch was disengaged. And I couldn't return it as I had already passed the Amazon return date. So, I purchased a second unit (the same model) hoping it would perform better. From the start, the actuator arm would not retract (open) all the way. It would open 45 degrees and simply stop. I had the limit switches set properly along with the Potentiometers. I tried running the motor off the the gate and still encountered the same issue. I reached out to the Topens tech support center via email. They were very responsive but I had essentially already tried everything they suggested. In sum, no amount of tech support can fix mediocre engineering (at best) and generally poor component quality. This unit is going back to Amazon. Here's my general assessment after spending hours messing with 3 of these things: Topens units are fundamentally "entry level" openers so you will have to manage your expectations. There are many plastic parts inside and out which I suspect will not provide robust and reliable performance for very long. Although my control boards seem OK, I've read in other places that quality control on those can be hit or miss. One thing that also annoys me is that there is absolutely no way to operate the unit without the key fobs. It would be nice to have an independent switch option inside the control box. In addition, the clutch mechanism, which is activated with a key, seems to lack that solid positive response. Occasionally, it's difficult to discern if the actuator is engaged or not. Finally, if you reside in an area which is prone to higher winds, you WILL notice play in the actuator arm which surely must be hard on the internal components. I was hoping to just get a decent unit without having to spend literally thousands on the nicer premium openers. Unfortunately, Topens has been mostly disappointing and there just doesn't seem to be many "middle market" products available to average consumers. | The product is reliable (explicit). |
