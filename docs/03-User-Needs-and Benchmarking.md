Using a trigger (this gate opener uses a key fob) the gate will swing open at a certain speed and a certain degree. This gate will also close in a similar fashion.

| "The Topen gate you manually set the at the arm as compared to the MM which you program with the remote. manual way is much easier to set. I had an electric lock already installed which works perfectly with the Topen. It quickly and easily hooked up to wifi, apple homekit and siri. Very easy setup and the support was immediately there to answer some pre and post purchases questions." | The product is easily adjusted (**Latent**).                                 |

| "Gate gave out completely after only a month or so of use in spite of the fact that the gate weight was well inside of the product specs. I couldn't move it manually even though the motor clutch was disengaged. The actuator arm would not retract (open) all the way. It would open 45 degrees and simply stop. I had the limit switches set properly along with the Potentiometers. I tried running the motor off the the gate and still encountered the same issue. One thing that also annoys me is that there is absolutely no way to operate the unit without the key fobs. It would be nice to have an independent switch option inside the control box. In addition, the clutch mechanism, which is activated with a key, seems to lack that solid positive response." | The product is reliable (**Explicit**).                                |

| "This gate system is not for someone who does not have significant experience doing wiring and general mechanical work. The gate moves very slowly and the wireless keypad has to be very close to the gate to work. You'll want to spend a lot of time in the design phase to have a quality end result. This system install is best left to a professional if you want a reliable and well functioning result. I have revised my design multiple times to get things working well and it's still not ideal. It's a pretty basic and cheap system."                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The product has a wide sensor range (**Explicit**).                    |
