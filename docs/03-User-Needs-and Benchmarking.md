Using a trigger (this gate opener uses a key fob) the gate will swing open at a certain speed and a certain degree. This gate will also close in a similar fashion.

| Ok, so I purchased two of these units based largely upon the reviews. I installed both on ranch gates: one 14 foot and one 16 foot. Installation process was, to be honest, lengthy and and labor intensive for me but the directions were quite good and straight forward. I also installed the solar panels with battery backups which appear to work well. So far, the unit on the 14 foot gate has worked problem free. Unfortunately, the unit I installed on the 16 foot gate gave out completely after only a month or so of use in spite of the fact that the gate weight was well inside of the product specs. For some reason, the screw (or nylon nut) inside of the actuator just froze up. I couldn't move it manually even though the motor clutch was disengaged. And I couldn't return it as I had already passed the Amazon return date. So, I purchased a second unit (the same model) hoping it would perform better. From the start, the actuator arm would not retract (open) all the way. It would open 45 degrees and simply stop. I had the limit switches set properly along with the Potentiometers. I tried running the motor off the the gate and still encountered the same issue. I reached out to the Topens tech support center via email. They were very responsive but I had essentially already tried everything they suggested. In sum, no amount of tech support can fix mediocre engineering (at best) and generally poor component quality. This unit is going back to Amazon. Here's my general assessment after spending hours messing with 3 of these things: Topens units are fundamentally "entry level" openers so you will have to manage your expectations. There are many plastic parts inside and out which I suspect will not provide robust and reliable performance for very long. Although my control boards seem OK, I've read in other places that quality control on those can be hit or miss. One thing that also annoys me is that there is absolutely no way to operate the unit without the key fobs. It would be nice to have an independent switch option inside the control box. In addition, the clutch mechanism, which is activated with a key, seems to lack that solid positive response. Occasionally, it's difficult to discern if the actuator is engaged or not. Finally, if you reside in an area which is prone to higher winds, you WILL notice play in the actuator arm which surely must be hard on the internal components. I was hoping to just get a decent unit without having to spend literally thousands on the nicer premium openers. Unfortunately, Topens has been mostly disappointing and there just doesn't seem to be many "middle market" products available to average consumers. | The product is reliable (explicit). |
| | The product stays powered over a long period of time (latent). |
| | The product should operate without the use of key fobs (explicit). |

| I am very mechanically inclined. This gate system is not for someone who does not have significant experience doing wiring and general mechanical work. The gate moves very slowly and the wireless keypad has to be very close to the gate to work. It rendered it usless in my case which Is a major problem for guests to the property. The remotes that come with the system also have very limited range. I bought the extended range add on and those remotes have other limitations. You'll want to spend a lot of time in the design phase to have a quality end result. This system install is best left to a professional if you want a reliable and well functioning result. I have revised my design multiple times to get things working well and it's still not ideal. It's a pretty basic and cheap system. It'll get the job done if you have enough time and experience and willingness to work for a good result long-term. Short-term you can throw it together in an afternoon but you'll have a lot of work ahead to make it reliable and look good. This is some cheap Chinese stuff. | The product has a wide sensor range (explicit). |
