## Lessons Learned

1. You don't alsways have to be creating something fully new and unique. Your goal is to improve your ability as an engineer and our team was so focused to creating something revolutionary that we lost sight of that goal. The best thing we did was find an invention and ask ourselves how we could improve it and how the general population would like it improved. 

2. We struggled in time management when it came to this project. As the days progressed we thought we had way more time than we actually did. This lead to some late night meetings and stress that could have been easily remmedied if we planned a bit more effectively. 

3. Though we communicated meetings and timelines, we constantly let life take a hold of our time and missed those meetings. There was a part of the team that was lax in those meetings because we were more focused on indiviually getting our work done. This was a problem later on when we needed to communicate on what each piece of information we were giving others. 

4. We wanted to add too many extra mechanical safety parts to a whole project which clouded our judgement when making user needs and benchmarking. We needed to focus on the programming part not the mechanical parts. 

5. We were fortunate enough to have all four teammates stay for the whole project. That being said, it was very good that we planned for worse case senarios if a sensor was unavailable. We could have also communicated a bit more on what would happen if the motor section was gone, but we felt like that would have to be taken up by someone else and a sensor dropped. 

6. We learned that PCBs have a lot more going on inside them than we had thought. We needed to really search and study data sheets to make sure each footprint was correct and there were still some footprints that were overlooked in that process. 

7. Our software proposal showed that we had complicated our programing with extra features we didnt nessecarily have to have. The main one was the calibration. Though it was good and important to have, that extended our time in programming because each sensor had two pieces of code it worked on. 

8. We learned to be extra careful on the 8-pin connectors and make sure that everyone knew where their information was going. This helped for when we had to plug our breadboards together. We had to do minimal reprogramming because of the pins. 

9. We learned that we had to really pay attention to what was asked of us in each assignment. There were times that something was almost overlooked or overlooked because the team skimmed the assignment page. 

10. In the end, we did learn that we could work well and complete a working program that interacted with three other subsystems to create a whole system. This was a great achievement in our path as engineers. 



## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Time Management

When planning projects and labs keep a schedule for how much time you will work on each and stick with it. YOu do not have as much time as you usually think you do. 

2. Realistic Planning

Make sure your ideas and goals for your project is realistic and can be achievable. Make sure you work hard, but do not bite off more than you can chew.

3. Communication

It is okay to miss team meetings or be lost in your code, but communicate, communicate, communicate. The ability to communicate with your team will help everyone work together in a smooth fashion and will help keep everyone accountable. 

4. Design Ideation

By Design Ideation you should have your project planned out and a rough schetch/idea on how everyone will work together in programing, information sharing, and workload/mamagement. If not, then by the time you are trying to build your project you will have more issues to fix that could have been resolved earlier on.

5. Office Hours

Office hours are there to help you. Even if you do not think you need it, use it or be there. That area is where a lot of people working on similar projects are available to bounce ideas off of. The TAs and teachers are great resources and those times are a great time for team meetings, program assistance, or overall checks about your progress in the class.
