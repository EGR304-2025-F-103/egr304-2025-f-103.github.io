title: Appendix - Limitations and Future
---

## Limitations

- System currently supports only specific door types (hinged/swing); not yet modular for sliding or specialty doors.
- Dependent on backup battery charge; performance drops or fails during power outage if battery is uncharged.
- Limited fire-safety integration in the event of a faulty or overheated battery.
- Redundancy in critical subsystems (sensors, motors, controllers) not fully implemented.
- Current prototype not yet validated for outdoor or high-traffic commercial use.
- Security features (anti-theft or override protection) need further enhancement.
- Sensor coverage limited; additional edge or laser sensors required for full safety compliance.
- No built-in interface for integration with existing smart-home ecosystems.
- System tested under controlled conditions; real-world performance may vary.

## Future

- Expand design to support modularity across multiple door types (swing, sliding, double).
- Add comprehensive power management and automatic battery health diagnostics.
- Integrate fire-safety features and battery temperature monitoring sensors.
- Implement dual-redundant control circuits to ensure fail-safe operation.
- Introduce adaptive algorithms to detect and respond to user proximity or obstacles dynamically.
- Enhance cybersecurity and physical tamper resistance.
- Develop smart-home and IoT integration for monitoring and control via mobile apps.
- Perform long-term durability and environmental testing.
- Document clear installation, calibration, and maintenance procedures.

## Summary

This appendix summarizes the current **limitations** and outlines **future directions** to enhance system robustness, safety, and usability.  
Key focus areas include modular design, validated ROI data, redundancy, and improved integration with smart-home platforms.  
Implementing these improvements will move the project closer to a commercially viable, reliable, and safe automatic door system capable of real-world deployment.
