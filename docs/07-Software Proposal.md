## Description

The purpose of this page is to visualize the overall software process of each subsystem and how they will interact with each other. The diagram below is an Activity Diagram using UML (Unified Modeling Language) symbolism. The black circle is the start of each subsystem's process. The elongated oval-type shapes represent actions performed by the software. The diamond shapes represent decisions made in the software based on logic. Solid lines between shapes represent the flow inside each subsystem's software. Dashed lines represent information being shared between subsystems.
