## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a product that will automatically open and close doors inside of consumers' homes or personal buildings. The idea of automatic doors is commonly seen in the public, such as in stores, workplaces, and other businesses to improve accessibility. This project aims to bring the idea into more personal settings such as the interior of homes/private buildings and to improve upon the design of the product. Ideally, the product will overcome competing brands by being a more affordable option and opening up a new group of target consumers. The current target by December 2025 is to have a working prototype with a consumer cost of under $300 which appeals to homeowners who are disabled as well as those simply wanting greater convenience and accesibility in their home. These goals will be achieved by scaling down the power requirements and making the product lighter-duty (lowering material cost therefore improving affordability), using sensors to make it touch-free, and designing it to be as easy to install and setup as possible.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Product users would be families, those with disabilities, and people who live in houses and work in buildings.
- **Target purchaser** The product purchasers would be home, building, and property owners.
- **Retailers** Construction companies and realtors who would sell this as an additional feature in new homes.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Matt**
25 year old Matt lives alone in his new house with a new puppy. Since he got it he has been meal prepping and slowly adding furniture to his house. He recently got this automatic door opener and closer for his backyard door, bedroom door, and door that leads to the garage. He found it really convinient to have his bedroom door and backyard door open and close themselves whenever his new puppy wanted to go out. This helped him not worry about his new puppy having accidents inside the house or his room while he is sleeping or at work.

Matt also has one installed on the door that leads to the garage. When he grabs groceries, he buys enough for the whole month. To make the trips from his car to the pantry the least amount possible his hands are usually full while he walks inside and he dropps a few items every time he opens the door. Having the door automatically open and close helps Matt grab as much as he can from his car to the kitchen without having to worry about trying to open the door with his hands full. His friends also commented how helpful this was when they were moving boxes from his old apartment to his new house. They just walked up towards the door and it opened for them without them having to set the boxes down and pick them back up.

**User Story #2: Mary**

Mary is a 32-year-old mother of newborn twins. Her hands are almost always full as she carries her babies around the house or moves baby supplies from room to room. Opening doors while holding both children is difficult and unsafe, so she installed the automatic door opener/closer on her bedroom, kitchen, and nursery doors. Now, when she approaches, the sensor recognizes her presence and automatically opens the door, allowing her to move through without putting the twins down or struggling with handles. This makes her daily routine far less stressful and keeps her focus on caring for her children.

As the twins grow older and become curious toddlers, Mary also uses the product on her kitchen cabinets. By enabling the lock and restriction settings, she prevents the children from opening cabinets that contain snacks, chocolate, or cleaning supplies. The clear LED signals help her know when a cabinet is secured, and the manual override via her phone app ensures she can open them easily when needed.

At night, Mary and her spouse can gently close and lock the nursery door once the twins are asleep. This gives them some privacy to watch a movie together or relax without worrying that the kids might wander out. For Mary, the automatic door system provides convenience during early motherhood, child safety as her kids grow, and peace of mind knowing her home is more manageable, secure, and family-friendly
