## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabraâ€™s lifestyle products.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Product users would be families, those with disabilities, and people who live in houses and work in buildings. 
- **Target purchaser** The product purchasers would be home, building, and property owners.
- **Retailers** Construction companies and realators who would sell this as an additional feature in new homes. 


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Matt**
25 year old Matt lives alone in his new house with a new puppy. Since he got it he has been meal prepping and slowly adding fruniture to his house. He recently got this automatic door opener and closer for his backyard door, bedroom door, and door that leads to the garage. He found it really convinient to have his bedroom door and backyard door open and close themselves whenever his new puppy wanted to go out. This helped him not worry about his new puppy having accidents inside the house or his room while he is sleeping or at work. 

Matt also has one installed on the door that leads to the garage. When he grabs groceries, he buys enough for the whole month. To make the trips from his car to the pantry the least amount possible his hands are usually full while he walks inside and he dropps a few items every time he opens the door. Having the door automatically open and close helps Matt grab as much as he can from his car to the kitchen without having to worry about trying to open the door with his hands full. His friends also commented how helpful this was when they were moving boxes from his old apartment to his new house. THey just walked up towards the door and it opened for them without them having to set the boxes down and pick them back up.

## Open Questions

* Can we have the product sense the difference between a child and an adult?

* Can we make the Auto Door lighter weight to help with installation and shipping? 
* Does looks and color affect customer's intrest in the product?
