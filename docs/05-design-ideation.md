## Generating Ideas

For each user need and product requirement, brainstorm 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy that requirement.

|                   requirement / need |             feature              | detail                                                                      |
| -----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The product must stop if something is in the way. |              Sensor              | The device has an additional sensor focusing on the doorway line to make sure there is nothing in the area. This is important because we do not want the door to shut on people, animals, or objects. |
| The product must stop if something is in the way. |             Smaller motor              | The device only produces a max of 10lbs of force. This is important because if someone gets stuck inbetween the door they can push the door to prevent closure. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |             Latch          | The device has a latch inside that unhindges the motor to the door causing the door to open without resistance. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |          button             | The device has a secret button that will turn the motor off to make opening the door easier. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |           pin/key            | The device disengages the motorwhen a key/pin is inserted through a hole. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product can stay closed around children |          Proximity/distance sensor             | This device will be able to stay closed if the object/person is too short. This is to prevent children or animals from getting into something they are not supposed to. This is important as it was stated in our user needs.  |
