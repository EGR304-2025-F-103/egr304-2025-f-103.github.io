## Generating Ideas

For each user need and product requirement, brainstorm 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy that requirement.

|                   requirement / need |             feature              | detail                                                                      |
| -----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The product must stop if something is in the way. |              Sensor              | The device has an additional sensor focusing on the doorway line to make sure there is nothing in the area. This is important because we do not want the door to shut on people, animals, or objects. |
| The product must stop if something is in the way. |             Smaller Motor              | The device only produces a max of 10lbs of force. This is important because if someone gets stuck inbetween the door they can push the door to prevent closure. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |             Latch          | The device has a latch inside that unhindges the motor to the door causing the door to open without resistance. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |          Button             | The device has a secret button that will turn the motor off to make opening the door easier. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product must be easy to open in an emergency |           Pin/Key            | The device disengages the motorwhen a key/pin is inserted through a hole. This is important because it refers to safety if the mechanism losed power. |
| The product can stay closed around children |          Proximity/distance sensor             | This device will be able to stay closed if the object/person is too short. This is to prevent children or animals from getting into something they are not supposed to. This is important as it was stated in our user needs.  |
| The product is able to work in case of a power outage |           Seperate Battery            | This is very important in case everything loses power. The device has a small battery that can power the door for an amount of time until the power gets back on. |
| The product will start opening before customer gets too close |           Forward Sensor            | This sensor will measure objects equal to the door length plus an additional 6-12 inches. This is important because the door should not open and hit the customer while in use. |
| The product distinguishes between adults, kids, and animals. |            Distance Sensor           | This device will distinguish between different heights to promote safety and prevent kids or animals from opening doors that they should not open. |
| The product can lock/unlock the door |           Slider            | The device will have a slider installed next to the door latch. This will slide before and after the door moves. This is important because some doors should stay locked/closed wile the device does not activate. |
| The product can lock/unlock the door |           Pulley            | The device has a pully that is run with the motor. This will pull at the latch to unlock the latch. |
| The product has an auto close feature. |            Delay in Sensor           | After someone leaves the sensor view, there will be a delay then it will start closin. THis is important so that the door can be closed and locked depending on user preference. |
| The product has a simple power supply. |           Battery            | The device has a battery that powers it. This will be convienient so that there are no extra wires outside the product. |
| The product has a simple power supply. |          Wired             | The device has a power wire that runs around the door and into a power outlet. This prevents the device from needing to have batteries replaced and suplies constant power. |
| The product has a simple power supply |           Solar            | The device will have a small solar panel on the side. This will help recharge the device as long as it is near a light source. |
| The product has 90 or 180 degree openability. |           360 Motor            | The door opens as much as it can by connecting the door straight to the motor. |
| The product has 90 or 180 degree openability. |            Teethed Pulley           | The motor is connected to a pulley that will pull the door open. This will also work in reverse which will help push the door closed. |
| The product has 90 or 180 degree openability. |           Mechanical Arms            | The motor is connected to mechanical arms that will rotate and bend to open the door. This will prevent loss of tension and can help with how much power the motor is using. |
| The product does not interfere with manual opening of doors. |           Auto-Disengage Program            | If the device senses someone trying to open the door and it is not in a lock setting, then the device will disengage the motor so that the motor is not fighting the user in opening the door. |
| The product stops operation when sensing more resistance than usual. |          Auto-Disengage Program             | This can happen if the door is locked, latched, or something is blocking the door. To prevent damage to the device and the obects, the device will disengage the motor after it exerts more than 10 lbs of force. |
| The door can stay closed while the customer is gone. |          Latch             | The device can come with a latch on the top of the door so that when closed, the latch engages and locks the door for the user. |
| The door can stay closed while the customer is gone. |          Slider            | The user can engage or disengage a slider. This will prevent the device from using the slider to unlock the door and keep the door closed. |
| The door can stay closed while the customer is gone. |          Off Switch             | When the user leaves, they can press a delayed off switch that will turn off the motor after 10 min. This means that the next time the customer comes to the door, they will either have to open it themselves or turn the motor back on. |
| The device does not stay on all day |          Timer             | The device has a timer that will turn the motor off after 10 min. THe sensor will stay on and turn the motor back on if it senses movement. |
| he device does not stay on all day |            Clock           | The device will have a clock which can program the device to turn off during certain times of the day. This is important because it turns the whole device off which saves energy and prevents door from automatically opening when the user does not want them to open. |
| The product must follow ADA rules |          Distance Sensor             | The device will read at least 32 inches from the door for when the door opens forward so that it follows ADA compliance. This will also prevent the door from opening infront of users and colliding with objects that are mothing toward the door. |
